# Task 3: Student Database Create a dictionary named student with the following keys: "name", "age", "city", and "subjects".
# Set the values to: "Alice", 20, "New York", and a list ["Math", "Physics"].
# Add a new key-value pair: "grade": "A".
# Update the student's city to "London".
# Remove the "age" key from the dictionary.
# Print only the keys of the dictionary, and then print only the values.




# Task 4: Inventory Manager Create a dictionary called inventory where keys are item names and values are their quantities: inventory = {"apples": 10, "bananas": 5, "oranges": 8}.
# Write a script that checks if "grapes" is in the dictionary. If not, add it with a quantity of 12.
# Increase the number of "apples" by 5.
# Calculate and print the total number of items in the inventory (sum of all values).
