# Remove "bread" from the list because you found some at home.
# Print the final list and the length of the list.


# Task 2: The Secret Code Creator
# Topics: Strings, Indexing, Slicing
#
# The Goal: Create a "code" by rearranging a word.
# Ask the user to input a single word that has at least 6 letters.
# Create a new "secret" word by taking the first 3 letters and the last 3 letters of their word.
# Print this new shortened version.
# Example: If the word is "Keyboard", the output should be "Keyord".

# (04.02)
# Task 1: The Substring Extractor Write a program that takes a string text = "PythonProgramming".
# Extract and print the first 6 characters.
# Extract and print the word "Programming" using a slice.
# Print every second character of the string.
# Reverse the string using slicing and print the result.



# Task 2: List Trimming You have a list of numbers: numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100].
# Create a new list called middle_part that contains all elements from index 2 to index 7 (inclusive).
# Create a list that contains only the last 3 elements of the original list.
# Replace the elements from index 0 to 2 with the values [1, 2, 3].
#


# Task 3: Student Database Create a dictionary named student with the following keys: "name", "age", "city", and "subjects".
# Set the values to: "Alice", 20, "New York", and a list ["Math", "Physics"].
# Add a new key-value pair: "grade": "A".
# Update the student's city to "London".
# Remove the "age" key from the dictionary.
# Print only the keys of the dictionary, and then print only the values.


# Task 4: Inventory Manager Create a dictionary called inventory where keys are item names and values are their quantities: inventory = {"apples": 10, "bananas": 5, "oranges": 8}.
# Write a script that checks if "grapes" is in the dictionary. If not, add it with a quantity of 12.
# Increase the number of "apples" by 5.
# Calculate and print the total number of items in the inventory (sum of all values).

# Tasks for 09.02

# Task 1: The Guest List (List & If)
# Scenario: You are managing a party guest list.
# Data: Create a list called guests = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"].
# Logic: * Check if "Eve" is in the list.
# If she is not, add her to the end of the list.
# If the list now has more than 4 people, print "The party is full!"; otherwise, print "Keep inviting friends!
#
#
# Task 2: The Smart Home Alarm (Logical and / not)
# Scenario: You are programming a security system. The alarm should only trigger if the system is armed AND a sensor is tripped, but NOT if it's maintenance mode.
# Data: * is_armed = True
# sensor_tripped = True
# is_maintenance = False
# Logic:
# Write an if statement using and and not.
# If the alarm condition is met, print "ALARM! Calling police..."; otherwise, print "System secure."
#
#
#
# Task 3: The Data Validator (Truthiness & elif)
# Scenario: You are validating a user's profile. A profile is "Incomplete" if the username is empty, "Unverified" if the email is missing, and "Active" only if both exist.
# Data:
# username = "Dev_User123"
# email = "" (empty string)
# Logic:
# Use the "truthiness" of strings (an empty string "" is False).
# If NOT username, print "Error: Username is required."
# elif NOT email, print "Warning: Email is missing."
# else, print "Profile is valid."
