# Task 1: The Grocery Swap
#
# The Goal: You have a shopping list: ["apples", "milk", "bread", "eggs"].
# Add "chocolate" to the end of the list.
# The store is out of "milk". Replace it with "oat milk".
# Remove "bread" from the list because you found some at home.
# Print the final list and the length of the list.


# Task 2: The Secret Code Creator
# Topics: Strings, Indexing, Slicing
#
# The Goal: Create a "code" by rearranging a word.
# Ask the user to input a single word that has at least 6 letters.
# Create a new "secret" word by taking the first 3 letters and the last 3 letters of their word.
# Print this new shortened version.
# Example: If the word is "Keyboard", the output should be "Keyord".
